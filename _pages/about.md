I am a recent psychology graduate from the University of Buckingham and I am currently working as a Research Associate on several projects at Oxford Brookes University. These projects include investigating the role of language experience in the development of the mutual exclusivity bias in the BabyLab and conducting a systematic literature review on preparing graduates for interdisciplinary collaboration in the workplace as part of the Innovation Award Grant. I am also involved in the Junior Researcher Programme where I research the relationship between social media use and emotion recognition in adolescents in four European countries. My primary research interests include the development of word-learning heuristics and the relationship between language and cognition in early childhood development.
