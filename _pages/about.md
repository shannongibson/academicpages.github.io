I graduated with first-class honours in Psychology from the University of Buckingham in December 2018. I am currently working as a Postgraduate Research Assistant on ["The effects of social distancing policies on children's language development, sleep and executive functions"](https://babylab.brookes.ac.uk/research/social-distancing-and-development) project at the Oxford Brookes Babylab. I will also be starting my PhD in the [Oxford Brookes Babylab](https://babylab.brookes.ac.uk/) in September 2021 with a focus on the development of word-learning heuristics in monolingual and bilingual infants.
