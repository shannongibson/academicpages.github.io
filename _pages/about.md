I am a recent psychology graduate from the University of Buckingham and I am currently working as a Research Associate on several projects at Oxford Brookes University. These projects include investigating the role of language experience in the development of the mutual exclusivity bias and exploring infant's understanding of abstract concepts, such as, emotions, prepositions and adjectives. My primary research interests include the development of word-learning heuristics and the relationship between language and cognition in infancy and early childhood development. 

I am also involved in adminstering the Intelligence and Development Scale (2nd Edition) as part of a UK-wide standardisation project and conducting a systematic literature review on preparing graduates for interdisciplinary collaboration in the workplace as part of the Innovation Award Grant. Additionally, I am involved in the Junior Researcher Programme where I focus on open science practices and reproducibility in social media use research.
