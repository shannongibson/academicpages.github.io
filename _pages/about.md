I graduated with first-class honours in Psychology from the University of Buckingham in December 2018. I am currently working on several projects before starting my PhD in September in the [Oxford Brookes University BabyLab](https://babylab.brookes.ac.uk/). These projects include investigating the role of language experience in the development of the mutual exclusivity bias and exploring infant's understanding of abstract concepts, such as, emotions, prepositions and adjectives. My primary research interests include the development of word-learning heuristics in monolingual and bilingual infants, and the relationship between language and cognition in early infancy. 

I am also conducting a systematic literature review on preparing graduates for interdisciplinary collaboration in the workplace as part of the Innovation Award Grant. Additionally, I am involved in the Junior Researcher Programme where I focus on open science practices and reproducibility in social media use research.
