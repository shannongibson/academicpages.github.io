I am a recent psychology graduate from the University of Buckingham. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Oxford Brookes University BabyLab under the guidance of Dr Nayeli Gonzalez-Gomez. I am primarily interested in the development of word-learning heuristics and the relationship between language and cognition in early childhood development.
